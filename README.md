# Classifier-Dimension-Performance-Analysis-For-Medical-Condition-Predictions

This project does an analysis on how machine learning can be effective when it comes to predicting medical conditions, such as breast cancer.
Many algorithms are explored in this project and a lot of data science is involved so that the data is preprocessed in the desired manner.
